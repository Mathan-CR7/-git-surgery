        The India Today Conclave is India's premier annual thought leadership forum, running for over two decades (since at least 2002) and hosting global leaders, thinkers, and cultural figures to discuss India's future, geopolitics, economy, and social issues. It's known as an "Intelligence Exchange," bridging policy and scholarship with debates and solutions for national progress, featuring diverse speakers from politics (like CMs), business, defense, Bollywood, and academia. Recent editions, like the 2025 Conclave, have focused on themes of innovation, AI, global standing, and cultural narratives, continuing its role as a major platform for national dialogue.
